/* https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/javatutorial/
java_package specifies in what Java package name your generated classes should live. If you don’t specify this explicitly, it simply matches the package name given by the package declaration, but these names usually aren’t appropriate Java package names (since they usually don’t start with a domain name). The java_outer_classname option defines the class name of the wrapper class which will represent this file. If you don’t give a java_outer_classname explicitly, it will be generated by converting the file name to upper camel case. For example, “my_proto.proto” would, by default, use “MyProto” as the wrapper class name. The java_multiple_files = true option enables generating a separate .java file for each generated class (instead of the legacy behavior of generating a single .java file for the wrapper class, using the wrapper class as an outer class, and nesting all the other classes inside the wrapper class).
